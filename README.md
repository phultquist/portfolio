# Portfolio
This portfolio is made with Next.JS (`./web`) and Sanity (`./studio`).

## Why NextJS?
I have become comfortable with react and wanted good SEO and speed. I was also impressed with how developer friendly NextJS is. 

## Why Sanity?
I had become frustrated with all the different formats I needed to display work -- one column resume, two column resume, portfolio website, etc. It seemed like the classic issue in computer programming of having different unsynced copies of data in all different places; so when one changed, I had to change it everywhere (and inevitably forgot). Simply put, sanity solves this problem, by treating my content as data and keeping it in one centralized location.
